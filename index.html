            <p>It all began as a small project—a simple way to share my creative work with the world. At first, it was just a personal experiment, a cozy little corner on the internet to store and share my creations. But soon, it grew beyond that, transforming into a vibrant hub where I could showcase comics, videos, animations, and every idea that sparked in my mind. The first comics were quick sketches, funny strips that captured random thoughts or quirky scenarios. I thought a few people might enjoy them, but they gained momentum, drawing people in who resonated with the characters and laughed along. That’s when I realized that even a few frames could convey humor, emotion, and meaning—and the more I created, the more I wanted to push my boundaries.</p>
            <p>I ventured into videos next, fascinated by the idea of bringing stories to life with movement, dialogue, and sound. They started rough and unpolished, but they were real, and people connected with that authenticity. Every project was a new chance to learn something, from editing to timing a punchline. Then came animation, a total game-changer, merging the storytelling of comics with the fluidity of video to create something alive and immersive. Watching my characters move felt like watching my imagination in real-time. What started as a collection of creative experiments has grown into a shared journey. Today, it’s a space people return to for a laugh, a story, or a new animated world. And the best part? This is only the beginning—the ideas are limitless, and there’s so much more to come.</p>

            <p>Constantine John Phipps was the first to describe the polar bear as a distinct species in 1774 in his report about his 1773 expedition towards the North Pole. He chose the scientific name Ursus maritimus, the Latin for "maritime bear", due to the animal's native habitat. The Inuit refer to the animal as nanook (transliterated as nanuq in the Inupiat language). The Yupik also refer to the bear as nanuuk in Siberian Yupik. In the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages of Alyutor and Koryak, the name of the polar bear is umqa, while in the related Chukchi, it is umqə. In Russian, it is usually called бе́лый медве́дь (bélyj medvédj, 'white bear'), though an older word still in use is ошку́й (Oshkúj, which comes from the Komi oski, "bear"). In Quebec, the polar bear is referred to by the french terms ours blanc ('white bear') or ours polaire ('polar bear'). In Norwegian, one of the primary languages of the Svalbard archipelago, the polar bear is referred to as isbjørn ('ice bear') or kvitbjørn ('white bear').</p>
			<p>The polar bear was previously considered to be in its own genus, Thalarctos. However, evidence of hybrids between polar bears and brown bears, and of the recent evolutionary divergence of the two species, does not support the establishment of this separate genus, and the accepted scientific name is now therefore Ursus maritimus, as Phipps originally proposed.</p>
